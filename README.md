## Requirements

1. Install docker an docker-compose if you do not have them installed
2. Clone this scrapers project into the the folder `scrapers` in this project: https://github.com/feydan/scrapers-us-municipal. Stay in the main branch
3. Clone this sacramento-councilmatic project into the folder `sacramento-councilmatic` into this project: https://github.com/code4sac/sacramento-councilmatic . As of January 2020: Ensure that this is in the councilmatic-stack branch.

## Initializing

1. Run `docker-compose up` to start the database and scrapers containers. Keep this terminal window running.
2. Run the initial migration for scrapers `docker-compose exec scrapers pupa dbinit us`
3. Run the initial migration for councilmatic `docker-compose exec councilmatic python manage.py migrate`

## Running the scrapers

1. Ensure the containers are running. If they are still running from the Initializing step above continue to step 2. Otherwise start the containers: `docker-compose up`.
2. `docker-compose exec scrapers /bin/bash` (ssh's into the scrapers project)
3. `pupa update sacramento` (runs the update script)

## Todo

1. Fix bootstrapping so that you do not need to run the init scripts and have the update script automatically run on a cron job
